# Connecting with a VPC in Cube Cloud

For improved stability and security, Cube Cloud supports connecting to one or
more VPCs (virtual private clouds) in your Azure, AWS, or GCP accounts.

<InfoBox>

Requires [dedicated infrastructure][ref-dedicated-infra].
Available on [Enterprise and above plans](https://cube.dev/pricing).

</InfoBox>

VPC connection improves stability through dedicated infrastructure for a
deployment and improves security by preventing your database traffic from being
routed through the public internet.
